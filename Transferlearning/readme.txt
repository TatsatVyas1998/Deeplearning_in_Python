This is a simple transfer learning project using Pytorch. For this project, I have used the Linnaeus 5 dataset, which is publically available at http://chaladze.com/l5/. I have used a pre-trained VGG16 as well as Resnet50 to observe the difference in the performance and accuracy of both models. Both models achieved very high accuracies. However, Resnet50 achieved the highest accuracy of 95.6%.
